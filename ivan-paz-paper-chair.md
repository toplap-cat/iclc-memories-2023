Live coding reaches different spaces form the design of domain specific languages to live coding without computers.
It is challenging to represent this diversity with limited (4 for example) paper sessions, giving each theme its space, creating dialog across disciplines and at the same time promoting the diversity not only of proposals but also of backgrounds, realities and identities of the live coders.
