# iclc papers

Live coding reaches different spaces form the design of domain specific languages to live coding without computers.
It is challenging to represent this diversity with limited (4 for example) paper sessions, giving each theme its space, creating dialog across disciplines and at the same time promoting the diversity not only of proposals but also of backgrounds, realities and identities of the live coders.
As expressed in the manifesto draft live coding is not about tools, is about thoughts, but also about community.  

## Reviewing process
The paper review process becomes complicated when there are few reviewers. In our case, most of the reviewers accepted performances but fewer accepted to review papers. This, coupled with the complexity that the papers cover very diverse disciplines, makes it difficult, for example, 4 reviewers to read the same paper and be able to obtain the average of a more "diverse" reading.
