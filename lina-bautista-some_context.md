# Some context
(based on the toplap.org post written by some of the organisers)

In our case, the idea of organising the ICLC started within the on-the-fly project, as a continuation of the idea of fostering Live Coding. The project, funded by Creative Europe, ended in October 2022, and we thought that a good continuation of that spirit could be organising this ICLC. Since organising something like this involves a lot of work (and we knew this because some of us worked on the Madrid ICLC in 2019), and this conference is a self-sustaining project we decided to share the work; we didn't have the figure of a single "chair", which has made some things easier, but others challenging.


**Submissions**

We received 191 submissions for peer review, including papers, community reports, workshops, performances, and video documents. Regarding diversity, while proposals for performances and workshops were more balanced regarding gender and location, those of papers were rather biased towards men living in countries of the global north. This should raise the attention of a concern about the diversity.

From a total of 33 papers received, we were able to accept 16, which results in an acceptance rate of 48%. We struggled deciding whether to reduce the time for each presentation in order to accept more, but we were inclined to give each participant their time. However, it is clear that for further editions we have to find more creative ways to present so that more papers can be included. We also have to think if they should all be presented in the same way, there could be demos for example. This, without falling into the traditional poster sessions, which when mishandled give the sensation of being a kind of "second-class accepted proposals". We need to address this as the live coding community aims to have a conference with as high acceptance rate as possible, providing an inclusive space for discussion.

Paper sessions are organised into these broad categories: Languages - Recent Developments around Live Coding Languages & Notations, Hybrid Systems - Interfacing Live Coding with the Rest of the World, Performance Concepts & Art Practice - Aesthetic considerations etc. and Social Implications & Education.
Something we noticed during the reviewing process is - maybe this time it was just a coincidence- that "scientific" papers are consistently scored above "no scientific ones" by the reviewers. This could be part of a well known phenomenon that observes that we tend to be less critic with [research that follows specific rules](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=1adb938528dc17013b0b86483a355ce90a98319f), we need to be aware of this and other biases that appear in the conference.

Regarding performances, we received 118 performance proposals between Algorave performances and all type of concerts. We'll have a total of 42 acts, divided in 7 concerts with different approaches. We also struggled with the time slots versus the number of performances we received, it's been a tremendous work to deal with all the technicalities and specifications of everyone.

It was predetermined at the call opening that 100% of Community Reports would be accepted to the proceedings, this being a primary focus and an area where academic gatekeeping would be inappropriate and counterproductive. A total of 8 communities presented papers and documentaries, and we included a panel for discussion and Q&A about the evolution of live coding communities around the world.

We received 14 workshop submissions. Only one didn't make the cut, and another one withdrew after it had been accepted. The one that got the best score is actually not a workshop, but a visualists meetup.  There was an interesting balance between workshops for live coding music and visuals, and room for two theoretical workshops: one about documentation and another one for packaging tools.

Videos came in short form (<5 mins) and long form, with 11 entries and 7 submissions accepted. Videos have published the videos on ICLCâ€™s YouTube channel and in the proceedings of the conference.
