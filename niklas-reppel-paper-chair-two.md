# ICLC 2023 Memories and Conclusions (Niklas Reppel)

From the perspective of one of the paper chairs.

## Start Early!

Our goal was to be ready early enough so that all invited contributors could get their
funding/bureaucratic situation figured out. Ultimately we had some delay publishing the 
final results as we had plenty of submissions.

This was our original "roadmap":

* October 07, 2022: Call for submissions
* October 17, 2022: Submission system opening and templates available
* December 15, 2022: Deadline for submissions of papers, videos, performances and workshops
* December 18, 2022: Deadline for final updates to your submission before review 
* January 15, 2022: Deadline for submissions of proposals for satellite events
* January 23, 2023: Notification of acceptance
* March ??, 2023: Deadline for updating selected written submissions
* March 15, 2023: Camera-ready deadline for proceedings
* March 2023: Conference registration opens
* April 19-23, 2023: CONFERENCE DAYS!

## A Good Submission System is Worth a Lot!

Having a good submission system makes your life way easier. Due to budget restraints (and
the fact that we were a team of organizers independent from any university),
we opted for a free, self-hosted version of OpenConf, which has plenty of limitations.
We supplemented it with Google Forms to guide the reviewers through the process. 

It turned out to be confusing to the reviewers, and it was somewhat difficult to extract
all the data in a way that the committee could access it. Ultimately we managed, but 
we could have saved plenty of time with an integrated system.

If you already have (institutional) access to a submission system (such as EasyChair or Microsoft CMT), 
this might not apply to you. 

Unfortunately once-free solutions such as EasyChair come at a hefty price tag nowadays, but from 
the experience dealing with a very limited system, it might be worth consideration.

## Have Good Submission Templates Ready!

As it is tradition by now for ICLC, we offered submission templates in doc/docx and markdown formats. 
They were ported from previous ICLCs, and needed some maintenance.

Ultimately, we ported all of them to Latex (**pandoc is your friend here!**) and did some 
Latex doctoring for the final layout. Especially for the papers, the markdown and doc versions
didn't match as nicely as we hoped, so we saved them as docx, pandoc'd them to latex, and 
did some fine-tuning there. 

*You might save yourself some of the work by aligning all templates in advance.*

Keep in mind that the live coding community has a *strong focus on FLOSS software*, so if you
only provide one type of template, make sure everyone has the means to edit them. Not everyone
in this community uses/has access to Word or other commercial products. 

The 2023 templates are available here, feel free to add your own for subsequent ICLCs:

## Reviewer Management

ICLC is a fairly interdisciplinary conference, so you'll need:

* reviewers with technical knowledge who can assess technical novelty ...
* reviewers with experience in the arts who can assess artistic submissions ...
* reviewers with experience in humanities to assess submissions regarding the social context of live coding ...
* and in some cases, reviewers that can assess all of these.

It's not always easy to find these people, especially people who are not an integral part
of the community.

The community is small and you'll have people who both submit their own entries and
review other entries. The situation isn't ideal, but hasn't lead to major problems 
so far.

For a curated list of reviewers, contact the steering committee.

## Reviewer Guidance

To help reviewers write meaningful reviews, it is helpful to think of some questions and categories to guide them.
Those should neither be too restrictive nor too open, and integrate well with the submission system.

## Selection of Results 

Due to the nature of things, you'll have plenty of submissions with the same reviewer score. In these cases, you might
select a submission that increases the conference's diversity, or work on a meaningful overall distribution of topics.
In our case (regarding the paper sessions), we had blocks on several topics, i.e. one block (of 3 papers) on language developments, 
one block on art practice, one on social implications, etc.

Depending on how long your conference will be, you'll have to decide how many papers you can accept. 

## Paper Sessions

We accepted 16 papers, distributed over 5 paper sessions. Community reports had their own time slot.

We allotted 20min for each presenter, as we wanted to make it worth it for the presenters.

On all but one session, we had the Q&A/Discussion round at the end. One session with 4 papers turned out a bit long, and had more diverse
topics, so we put the Q&A at the end of each presentation.

Putting the Q&A/Discussion round at the end turned out to be a good practice *when the paper session is homogenous* in terms of topics.

If you have to schedule a paper session with divergent topics, having the Q&A after each presentation might work out better.
