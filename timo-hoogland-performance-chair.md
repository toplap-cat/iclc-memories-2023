# ICLC 2023 Memories and Conclusions 

## by Timo Hoogland - Performance Chair and Local Production

### Performances

It can be helpful to inform performers early on what is available in terms of technical equipment (such as stereo/quad/octaphonic setups and the amount of screens that can be projected). This will help the artists to prepare for the specific setup and have enough time to rehearse at home. We had the issue that some acts requested 3 screens, which was not possible at the end. And also some were interested in quad (or other multi-speaker setups), but since this was confirmed quite late a few went on with just stereo.

To save yourself a lot of time I suggest to let artists be as selfsufficient as possible (in terms of bringing their own soundcards and other equipment etc) so you don't have to take care of little details for every act.

The technical questionnaire that we included with the proposal template helped to get a good first overview of what to expect from every performance in terms. But still one-on-one contact is needed to iron out all the details. Maybe the questionnaire needs a review.

It can be a good idea to state beforehand what the maximum length for performances is, and it can also help to ask for the proposed length in the questionnaire. We didn't do this, resulting in us having to mail every act seperately to ask for their proposed length. Then we also had acts that wanted to perform 45 minutes. I think that 20-30 minutes is usually the best length since it will be multiple performances on one evening. Also 6 performances for a seated concert is good but also already quite a lot, more is not recommended.

9-10 performances for an Algorave is great. I recommend informing artists early on that they have to setup their set during the performance of the previous act to minimize the chang-over time. A long table with many inputs works great, and some individual soundcheck times where the artists can leave their soundcard on stage afterwards. A backup music playlist to play between performances could be a good option if it is not possible to have quick chang-overs, so it doesn't get completely quiet in the venue.

Many technicians from venues underestimate(d) the amount of work it takes to setup/soundcheck for a live coding performance. They quickly jump to the conclusiong this is "just a DJ set, right?". Helping them see that live coding is more like soundchecking a large band with many instrumentalists can make a difference.

Drawing a detailed stageplan and inputlist based on the line-up for every concert evening helps the technicians from the venues to visualize what to expect.

### Documenting

If you want to record all the performances (audio + video) make sure to assign this to a dedicated person (or maybe even a small team). We decided early on to not live-stream the concerts. But when the conference came closer a lot of artists requested/asked if it will be recorded. We did not have anything arranged for that, so last minute we just connected a Zoom recorder to the mixer and luckily one person from the community brought a camera and filmed almost all of the concerts.

### Lunch

Lunch concerts are nice, but I think the performance has to fit in the setting. Having enough time for lunch is also important. In our schedule it was maybe a bit too tight between paper sessions and the keynote in the middle of the day. Paper sessions can run a bit later, leaving less time for lunch. And if the keynote has to start on time you'll have to make sure people leave lunch on time as well.

### Keynote

If you plan to have a keynote speaker join online then I think it is a good idea to rehearse this properly and make sure the connection is (very) good. Otherwise a pre-recorded video might be a better alternative to make sure all the speech is clearly audible. The speaker could then join online after the keynote via zoom for a live Q&A for example.

### Website

The website can be added as a folder to the github repo from iclc.github.io. We started with a one-pager (simple black/white) with just the open call and all the necessary information/urls such as the timeline with important dates. We then moved on to a simple html and css website made with bootstrap.js and started out from a basic template.

Make sure to start early with compiling a list of affordable accomodations, and also contacting those accomodations for requesting optional discounts. We were a bit late with these, resulting in many questions from the community where they could best stay.

### Open Call

Start soon and give enough time between acceptance notification and the performance date (preferably 6 months). In some countries applying for travel funds can take 6 months to be processed and accepted. Contributors from those countries have a hard time joining the ICLC since they are not able to get there funding in time. This resulted in some cancellations or performers joining online.

### Reviewing/Selection

Many proposals for performances were scored high based on just the peer reviewing, meaning that we had to still to reject performances even tho they were scored "accept". Having a couple more people as performance chairs helped to dicuss amongst eachother which would make the cut and which ones not.

Some performances will get canceled due to lack of financial means (for travel/accomodation) or because of not being available. It is helpful to have a list of proposals that can serve as an alternative in case a performance drops out. We informed proposals as Accepted, Alternative or Rejected.
